why does favicon request lead to login?

- make this work with postgresql

- multiple tenanted sqlite dbs

- web sockets for long-running reports and alerts

- email notifications for failed requests

- email notifications for failed background jobs?

- update delete test error check to use errors.Is

- update query_builder to use QueryContext and QueryRowContext

mailer:
- add tests for mailer where I test the actual template itself

- what happens to mails in progress when the server is shutdown?
